# /wrapup

Save your session status before clearing context.

## Usage

```
/wrapup
```

## What It Does

1. **Updates CLAUDE.md**
   - Updates Current Status table with task progress
   - Sets clear next action

2. **Archives Done items**
   - Removes completed rows from Current Status
   - History preserved in git commits and Records

3. **Prunes Recent Decisions**
   - Removes implementation details already captured in Records
   - Removes entries superseded or only relevant to completed features
   - Keeps only project-level decisions useful for future work

4. **Creates Records (if needed)**
   - If significant decisions or designs were made
   - References in Current Status or Future table if actively relevant

5. **Checks Development, Files, Architecture sections**
   - Updates these sections if the session's work changed them
   - Keeps structural documentation current without manual effort

6. **Reviews missed decisions**
   - Checks if any project-level decisions should be in Recent Decisions
   - Adds them as a safety net

7. **Git commit**
   - Solo mode: Only commits Records and code
   - Team mode: Also commits CLAUDE.md updates

## Example Output

```
Updated CLAUDE.md:
- JWT auth: Done
- Added Record 015 for auth decision
- Next step: Implement password reset

Committed: docs: update project status

Ready for /clear
```

## Solo vs Team Mode

| Mode | CLAUDE.md | Records |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Solo | Not committed | Committed |
| Team | Committed | Committed |

## When to Use

- Context usage at ~80%
- End of work session
- Before switching to another project

## After /wrapup

Run `/clear` to start fresh. Your next session begins with `/catchup`.
