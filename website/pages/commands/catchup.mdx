# /catchup

Resume your work after `/clear` or a new chat session.

## Usage

```
/catchup
```

## What It Does

1. **Checks project template version** - Compares your project CLAUDE.md version marker against the installed template. On mismatch, triggers the migration command to offer adding missing sections or removing outdated ones

2. **Reads project README.md** - Understands project purpose and structure

3. **Reads changed files** - Uses `git diff --name-only HEAD~10` to see recent changes

4. **Loads relevant Records** - Checks Current Status table for in-progress work with Record references

5. **Checks Recent Decisions** - Reads small decisions that survived the last `/clear`

6. **Reads open private notes** - Loads `docs/notes/*.open.md` files with session context

7. **Loads context skills** - Matches your Tech Stack to coding standards

8. **Summarizes** - Shows what changed, open notes, and what's next

## Example Output

```
Project: claude-code-setup
Tech Stack: Bash, Markdown

Recent changes:
- Added JWT authentication (3 files)
- Updated user model

Records loaded:
- Record 015: Auth decision (in-progress work)

Open notes:
