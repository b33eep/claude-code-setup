# /claude-code-setup

Check status and update Claude Code Setup from within Claude.

## Usage

```
/claude-code-setup
```

## What It Does

1. **Checks versions**
   - Compares installed version with available version
   - Shows what's new in the update

2. **Offers actions**
   - Upgrade base modules
   - Upgrade custom modules
   - Install new modules (Skills, MCP servers, External plugins)

## Example Output

```
Claude Code Setup Status:

Installed: v22
Available: v23

Changes in v23:
- Decision Log feature
- Context quality improvements

What would you like to do?
1) Upgrade to v23
2) Check custom modules
3) Add new modules
4) Cancel
```

## Upgrade vs Fresh Install

| Action | What happens |
|--------|--------------|
| Upgrade | Preserves User Instructions section |
| Fresh install | Overwrites everything |

Your customizations in the "User Instructions" section of `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` are preserved during upgrades.

## Custom Modules

If you have custom modules installed (via `/add-custom`), this command also checks for updates to those.

```
Custom modules:
- company-standards: v2 → v3 available
- internal-mcp: up to date
```

## Modules Requiring API Keys

When installing MCP servers that require an API key, the interactive prompt cannot work within Claude Code (stdin is consumed by menu interactions).

In this case, Claude will:
1. **Insert the config directly** into `~/.claude.json` with a placeholder
2. Tell you where to get the API key
3. Instruct you to replace the placeholder

**Example output:**
```
MCP "brave-search" configured with placeholder.

Replace YOUR_API_KEY_HERE in ~/.claude.json with your actual key.

To get your API key:
1. Visit: https://brave.com/search/api/
2. Sign up for 'Data for AI' plan
3. Create an API key (free tier: 2000 queries/month)

Then restart Claude Code.
```

You only need to replace one value - no copy/pasting of JSON blocks required.

## External Plugins

External plugins (like `code-review-ai`) are installed directly via the Claude CLI:

1. Claude adds the marketplace if needed (`claude plugin marketplace add`)
2. Claude installs the plugin (`claude plugin install`)
3. You restart Claude Code to activate

**Example output:**
```
Installing external plugin code-review-ai...
  Adding marketplace claude-code-workflows...
  ✓ Marketplace claude-code-workflows added
  Installing code-review-ai...
  ✓ code-review-ai installed

Restart Claude Code to activate the plugin.
```

This is fully automatic - you just select which plugins to install.
