   - Upgrade base modules
   - Upgrade custom modules
   - Install new modules (--add)

## Example Output

## Upgrade vs Fresh Install

| Action | What happens |
|--------|--------------|
| Upgrade | Preserves User Instructions section |
| Fresh install | Overwrites everything |

Your customizations in the "User Instructions" section of `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` are preserved during upgrades.

## Custom Modules

If you have custom modules installed (via `/add-custom`), this command also checks for updates to those.

```
Custom modules:
- company-standards: v2 → v3 available
- internal-mcp: up to date
```

## Modules Requiring API Keys

When installing MCP servers or other modules that require an API key, the interactive prompt cannot work within Claude Code (stdin is consumed by menu interactions).

In this case, Claude will:
1. Install the module with a placeholder
2. Show you the exact configuration with the placeholder
3. Tell you where to get the API key
4. Instruct you to replace the placeholder in `~/.claude.json`

**Example:**
```
Note: MCP "brave-search" requires an API key.

To configure manually, add to ~/.claude.json under "mcpServers":

  "brave-search": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@brave/brave-search-mcp-server"],
    "env": {
      "BRAVE_API_KEY": "{{BRAVE_API_KEY}}"
    }
  }

Replace {{BRAVE_API_KEY}} with your key, then restart Claude Code.
```

This applies to any module with `requiresApiKey: true` in its JSON config.
