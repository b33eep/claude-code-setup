# /init-project

Set up a new project with CLAUDE.md and folder structure.

## Usage

```
/init-project
```

## What It Does

1. **Analyzes project**
   - Detects tech stack from package.json, pyproject.toml, etc.
   - Checks if Git repository

2. **Asks about sharing mode**
   ```
   How will you use CLAUDE.md in this project?

   1) Solo - Add to .gitignore (personal workflow, not shared)
   2) Team - Track in Git (shared context for all developers)
   ```

3. **Creates CLAUDE.md**
   - Uses template from `~/.claude/templates/`
   - Fills in detected project info
   - Adds common development commands

4. **Creates folder structure**
   - Creates `docs/records/` for decision documentation

5. **Updates .gitignore (Solo mode)**
   - Adds `CLAUDE.md` to `.gitignore`

6. **Git commit**
   - Commits initial setup

## Example Output

```
Created: CLAUDE.md
Created: docs/records/

Detected:
- Tech Stack: Python, FastAPI
- Mode: Solo (CLAUDE.md in .gitignore)

Next steps:
1. Review CLAUDE.md and adjust as needed
2. Add your first task to Current Status
3. Start working with /catchup
```

## Solo vs Team Mode

| Mode | Who sees CLAUDE.md | Use case |
|------|-------------------|----------|
| **Solo** | Only you | Personal notes, experiments |
| **Team** | Everyone | Shared status, handoffs |

Choose Solo if:
- Working alone on a project
- Don't want to share workflow notes
- Experimenting with different approaches

Choose Team if:
- Multiple developers on the project
- Want shared context across the team
- Project handoffs are common
