# Claude Code Setup

**Never lose context again.** Persistent memory, auto-loading coding standards, and a clear workflow for Claude Code.

## What We Solve

| Challenge | Without Setup | With Setup |
|-----------|---------------|------------|
| **Context fills up** | Lost progress, forgotten decisions | External memory in CLAUDE.md survives /clear |
| **"Where was I?"** | Start from scratch every session | `/catchup` shows changes and next steps |
| **Inconsistent code** | Different style every session | Coding standards auto-load per tech stack |
| **Lost decisions** | "Why did we do X?" forgotten | Records preserve reasoning permanently |
| **Team onboarding** | Manual setup, copy-paste standards | One command installs shared modules |
| **Setup overhead** | "What goes in CLAUDE.md?" | `/init-project` generates it for you |
| **Context monitoring** | "Is it getting full?" | Live status line shows `Ctx: 70%` |

## Quick Start

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/b33eep/claude-code-setup/main/quick-install.sh)
```

Then in Claude Code:

```
/init-project    # Set up your project
/catchup         # Start each session
/wrapup          # End each session (saves to CLAUDE.md)
/clear           # Clear context, start fresh
```

## Core Features

### Persistent Memory
Two CLAUDE.md files (global + project) serve as external memory that survives any context clear.

### Auto-Loading Standards
Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, Shell standards load automatically based on your tech stack. More coming soon.

### Session Workflow
Clear cycle: `/catchup` → work → `/wrapup` → `/clear`. No more lost progress.

### Team Support
Custom modules repo for shared standards. One command to install for all team members.
