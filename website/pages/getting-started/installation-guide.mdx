# Installation Walkthrough

import { Callout, Steps } from 'nextra/components'

This guide walks you through every step of the installation wizard and explains what each option does. If you just want the quick version, see the [Installation](/getting-started/installation) page.

## Before You Start

Make sure you have [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/download) installed and working. You should be able to run `claude` in your terminal.

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Claude Code | Required | The CLI tool this setup extends |
| macOS, Linux, or WSL | Required | All three platforms are supported |
| Node.js | Optional | Needed for the context status line (recommended) |

<Callout type="info">
Don't have Node.js? The installer works fine without it - you'll just skip the status line step. You can always add it later.
</Callout>

## Running the Installer

<Steps>

### Start the installer

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/b33eep/claude-code-setup/main/quick-install.sh)
```

Or clone and run locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/b33eep/claude-code-setup.git
cd claude-code-setup
./install.sh
```

### Dependencies check

The installer starts by detecting your operating system and ensuring it has what it needs:

```
Claude Code Setup Installer
============================

Dependencies
- OS: macOS (Homebrew)
+ jq installed
```

**What's happening:** The installer detects your OS (macOS, Ubuntu, Arch, Fedora, etc.) and installs `jq` if needed. `jq` is a small JSON processing tool that the installer uses internally to manage configuration files. You don't need to interact with `jq` yourself.

### Select MCP Servers

```
Select Modules

MCP Servers (toggle with number, Enter to confirm):

  ❯ ◉ pdf-reader - Read and analyze PDF documents
    ○ google-search - Web search via Google Custom Search API
    ○ brave-search - Web search via Brave Search API

  ↑↓ navigate  ⎵ toggle  ⏎ confirm
```

**What are MCP servers?** MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers give Claude extra tools - reading PDFs, searching the web, etc. Each server adds one capability.

**How to use this screen:** Use arrow keys (↑↓) to move between options, press Space to toggle an option on/off, and press Enter to confirm your selection.

Here's what each option does:

| Server | Pre-selected | API Key | What it does |
|--------|:---:|:---:|--------------|
| **pdf-reader** | Yes | No | Lets Claude read and analyze PDF files directly. Great for working with documentation, specs, or reports. |
| **google-search** | No | Yes | Lets Claude search the web during your session. Useful for looking up documentation, finding solutions, or researching libraries. |
| **brave-search** | No | Yes | Alternative to Google Search. Same purpose, different provider. You can only pick one search engine. |

<Callout>
**Recommendation:** Start with just **pdf-reader** (the default). You can always add a search engine later by running `./install.sh --add` or `/claude-code-setup` inside Claude Code.
</Callout>

**If you select a search engine**, the installer will ask for API keys during the installation step. For Google Search, you'll need to:
1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and enable the Custom Search API
2. Create a Google API key
3. Create a Custom Search Engine ID at [Programmable Search Engine](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/)

Both have free tiers that are sufficient for typical usage.

### Select Skills

```
Skills (toggle with number, Enter to confirm):

  ❯ ◉ create-slidev-presentation
    ◉ skill-creator
    ◉ standards-gradle
    ◉ standards-java
    ◉ standards-javascript
    ◉ standards-kotlin
    ◉ standards-python
    ◉ standards-shell
    ◉ standards-typescript
    ◉ youtube-transcript

  ↑↓ navigate  ⎵ toggle  ⏎ confirm
```

**What are skills?** Skills teach Claude coding standards and give it specialized tools. There are two types:

**Context skills** load automatically when relevant. If your project uses Python, the Python skill loads when Claude writes `.py` files. You never need to think about them - they just work.

| Skill | Languages/Frameworks |
|-------|---------------------|
| standards-python | Python, FastAPI, Django, Flask |
| standards-javascript | JavaScript, Node.js |
| standards-typescript | TypeScript, React, Next.js |
| standards-shell | Bash, Shell scripts |
| standards-java | Java |
| standards-kotlin | Kotlin, Android |
| standards-gradle | Gradle build files |

**Command skills** are invoked explicitly with a slash command:

| Skill | Command | What it does |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| skill-creator | `/skill-creator` | Helps you create your own custom skills |
| create-slidev-presentation | `/create-slidev-presentation` | Creates presentation slides using Slidev |
| youtube-transcript | `/youtube-transcript` | Downloads YouTube video transcripts with frame extraction |

<Callout>
**Recommendation:** Keep all skills selected (the default). They take up minimal space and only activate when relevant to your project. There's no downside to having them all installed.
</Callout>

### Select External Plugins

<Callout type="info">
This step only appears if the `claude` CLI is available on your system. If you don't see it, that's fine - you can add plugins later.
</Callout>

```
External Plugins (via Claude CLI):

  ❯ ○ document-skills - Excel, Word, PowerPoint, PDF creation/editing
    ◉ comprehensive-review - AI-powered code review with architecture, quality, and security agents (recommended)

  ↑↓ navigate  ⎵ toggle  ⏎ confirm
```

**What are external plugins?** Third-party plugins for Claude, installed via `claude plugin`. They add things like code review or document generation.

| Plugin | Pre-selected | What it does |
|--------|:---:|--------------|
| **comprehensive-review** | Yes | Multi-perspective code review with architecture, quality, and security agents. Integrates into the development workflow via `/do-review`. |
| **document-skills** | No | Lets Claude create and edit Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and PDF files. Useful if you work with office documents. |

<Callout>
**Recommendation:** Keep **comprehensive-review** selected. It's part of the recommended development workflow: write code, then get an automated review before committing.
</Callout>

### Installation

After confirming your selections, the installer sets everything up:

```
Installing Commands
+ init-project.md
+ wrapup.md
+ catchup.md
+ claude-code-setup.md
+ todo.md
+ design.md
+ add-custom.md
+ Project template installed

Installing MCP Servers

  Installing pdf-reader...
+ pdf-reader configured

Installing Skills
+ standards-python installed
+ standards-javascript installed
+ standards-typescript installed
+ standards-shell installed
+ standards-java installed
+ standards-kotlin installed
+ standards-gradle installed
+ create-slidev-presentation installed
+ skill-creator installed
+ youtube-transcript installed

Building CLAUDE.md
+ CLAUDE.md created
```

**What's happening:**
- **Commands** are slash commands you'll use in Claude Code (`/init-project`, `/wrapup`, `/catchup`, etc.)
- **MCP servers** get configured in `~/.claude.json` so Claude can use them
- **Skills** are copied to `~/.claude/skills/` where Claude reads them automatically
- **CLAUDE.md** is the global configuration file that drives the whole setup

If you selected an MCP server that requires API keys (like Google Search), you'll be prompted to enter them during this step:

```
Installing MCP Servers

  Installing google-search...

  Setup instructions:
    1. Visit: https://console.cloud.google.com/
    2. Enable Custom Search API
    3. Create API key and Custom Search Engine ID

  Enter your Google API key: AIza...
  Enter your Custom Search Engine ID: ...
+ google-search configured
```

### Status Line

```
Status Line

ccstatusline shows context usage in the status bar (e.g., Ctx: 21.9%)
Useful to know when to run /wrapup

Enable context status line? (Y/n):
```

**What is this?** The status line shows useful information at the bottom of your Claude Code session:

```
opus | 1.2k | 128k | Ctx: 21.9% | main | +2
```

| Segment | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `opus` | Current Claude model |
| `1.2k` | Tokens used in this session |
| `128k` | Maximum context window |
| `Ctx: 21.9%` | How full your context is |
| `main` | Current git branch |
| `+2` | Uncommitted changes |

**Why it matters:** The context percentage tells you when it's time to save your work. When it reaches ~80%, run `/wrapup` to document your progress, then `/clear` to start fresh. This prevents Claude from losing track of important decisions.

<Callout>
**Recommendation:** Press Enter or type `Y` to enable it. If you don't have Node.js installed, this step is skipped automatically.
</Callout>

### Update Notifications

```
Hooks
+ Update notification hook enabled
```

The installer automatically configures a hook that checks for updates when you start a new Claude Code session. If a newer version of claude-code-setup is available, you'll see a notification suggesting to run `/claude-code-setup` to update.

This step requires no input from you.

### Done!

```
Installation Complete

Installed to:
  ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
  ~/.claude/commands/
  ~/.claude/skills/
  ~/.claude/settings.json (user settings)
  ~/.claude.json (MCP configuration)

Next steps:
  1. New project: Run /init-project to set up CLAUDE.md
  2. After session: Run /wrapup to document and commit
```

</Steps>
