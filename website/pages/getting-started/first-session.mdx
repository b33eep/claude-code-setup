# First Session Walkthrough

A complete walkthrough of your first coding session with Claude Code Setup.

## Start Your Session

### 1. Open Claude Code in your project

```bash
cd your-project
claude
```

### 2. Run `/catchup`

If this is your first session after `/init-project`, `/catchup` will:
- Read your project's CLAUDE.md
- Load coding standards for your tech stack
- Show you what's next

```
You: /catchup
Claude: Project: Your Project
        Tech Stack: Python, FastAPI
        No recent changes (new project)
        Next step: Start with the first task
```

## Work on Your Task

### 3. Tell Claude what you want to build

```
You: Let's implement user authentication with JWT
```

Claude will:
- Read relevant files to understand the codebase
- Load Python coding standards (from your tech stack)
- Implement the feature following your project's patterns

### 4. Track important decisions

When Claude makes a significant decision:

```
You: Create a Record for why we chose JWT over sessions
```

This creates a permanent record in `docs/records/` that survives `/clear`.

## End Your Session

### 5. Watch context usage

Your status line shows:
```
Ctx: 75% | Model: opus | Branch: main
```

At ~80%, it's time to wrap up.

### 6. Run `/wrapup`

```
You: /wrapup
Claude: Updated CLAUDE.md:
        - JWT auth: Done
        - Added Record 001 for auth decision
        Committed changes.
```

### 7. Clear context

```
/clear
```

## Next Session

### 8. Resume with `/catchup`

```
You: /catchup
Claude: Recent changes:
        - Added JWT authentication
        - Record 001: Auth decision
        Next step: Add password reset
```

You're back where you left off, with full context of what was decided and why.

## Tips

- Don't wait until context is 100% - `/wrapup` at 80%
- Add decisions to Records as you make them, not later
- Use `/todo` to track tasks that come up during work
