# Disable Auto-Compact

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout type="warning">
This is critical. Auto-compact destroys context unpredictably. This setup uses `/wrapup` then `/clear` instead.
</Callout>

## Why Disable Auto-Compact?

Auto-compact summarizes your conversation when context fills up. This means:

- Lost implementation details
- Forgotten decisions and reasoning
- Inconsistent behavior between sessions
- No control over what gets preserved

## How to Disable

**Claude Code Settings** → `Cmd+,` (macOS) or `Ctrl+,` (Linux)

```
Auto-compact: false
```

## The Alternative Workflow

Instead of auto-compact, use the Document & Clear workflow:

1. **Work** until context fills (~80% shown in status line)
2. **Run `/wrapup`** to save status to CLAUDE.md
3. **Run `/clear`** to start fresh
4. **Run `/catchup`** to resume where you left off

This gives you full control over what gets preserved between sessions.

## Monitoring Context Usage

With [ccstatusline](https://github.com/sirmalloc/ccstatusline) installed, you'll see:

```
Ctx: 45% | Model: opus | Branch: main
```

When it hits ~80%, it's time for `/wrapup`.
