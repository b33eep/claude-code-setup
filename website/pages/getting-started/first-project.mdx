# First Project Setup

After installation, set up your first project with Claude Code Setup.

## Initialize the Project

In Claude Code, navigate to your project directory and run:

```
/init-project
```

Claude will:
1. Ask about your project (name, tech stack, description)
2. Generate a `CLAUDE.md` file with status tables and workflow
3. Ask if you want Solo or Team mode

## Solo vs Team Mode

| Mode | CLAUDE.md | Use case |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Solo** | In `.gitignore` | Personal notes, not shared |
| **Team** | Tracked in Git | Shared status for the team |

## What Gets Created

```markdown
# Your Project Name

## About

Your project description here.

## Tech Stack

- Python, FastAPI (or whatever you specified)

## Current Status

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Initial setup | Done | Project initialized |

## Records

| Decision | Choice | Record |
|----------|--------|--------|
| (empty - add as you go) |

## Development

### Commands

(Project-specific commands go here)
```

## Next Steps

1. Add your first task to the Current Status table
2. Start working on your project
3. When context fills up, use `/wrapup` then `/clear`
4. Next session, use `/catchup` to resume

See [First Session](/getting-started/first-session) for a walkthrough.
