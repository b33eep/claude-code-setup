# External Plugins

Install official Claude Code plugins via the installer.

## How It Works

External plugins are installed using the official `claude plugin` CLI. The installer:

1. Registers the plugin marketplace (if needed)
2. Installs the plugin via `claude plugin install`
3. Enables the plugin automatically

This is different from our Skills (which are copied to `~/.claude/skills/`). External plugins are managed by Claude Code itself.

## Available Plugins

### document-skills

Create and edit Office documents and PDFs.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Marketplace | anthropic-agent-skills |
| Source | [anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) |
| License | Source-available (proprietary) |

**Capabilities:**
- **Excel (xlsx)**: Create spreadsheets with formulas, charts, formatting
- **Word (docx)**: Create/edit documents with tracked changes, comments
- **PowerPoint (pptx)**: Create presentations from scratch or templates
- **PDF**: Extract text, tables, metadata; merge and annotate

**Usage:**
```
"Create a PowerPoint about our Q4 results"
"Edit this Word document and track changes"
"Extract tables from this PDF"
```

## Installation

External plugins are offered during installation:

```bash
./install.sh        # Fresh install
./install.sh --add  # Add to existing installation
```

You'll see a selection like:

```
External Plugins (via Claude CLI):

  ❯ ◉ document-skills - Excel, Word, PowerPoint, PDF creation/editing

  ↑↓ navigate  ⎵ toggle  ⏎ confirm
```

## Manual Installation

You can also install plugins directly via Claude Code:

```bash
# Add marketplace (once)
claude plugin marketplace add anthropics/skills

# Install plugin
claude plugin install document-skills@anthropic-agent-skills

# List installed plugins
claude plugin list
```

## Adding Custom Plugins

Create `~/.claude/custom/external-plugins.json`:

```json
{
  "marketplaces": {
    "my-company": {
      "repo": "mycompany/claude-plugins",
      "description": "Internal company plugins"
    }
  },
  "plugins": [
    {
      "id": "company-standards",
      "marketplace": "my-company",
      "description": "Company coding standards"
    }
  ]
}
```

These will appear in the installer alongside the default plugins.

## Requirements

- Claude Code CLI must be installed and available
- Network access during installation (plugins are downloaded)
- If CLI is not available, external plugins are skipped silently
