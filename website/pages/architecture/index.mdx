# Records

Records document decisions, feature designs, and rejected ideas - capturing the "why" behind this project.

They start as planning docs and become permanent documentation that survives any context clear.

## Key Decisions

### Workflow

- **No /compact** - Auto-compact is unpredictable. Use /wrapup + /clear instead.
- **Two CLAUDE.md files** - Global for workflow, project for status.
- **Records for decisions** - Permanent docs survive any context clear.

### Architecture

- **Monorepo for docs** - Code and docs in sync, one PR for both.
- **Skills over prompts** - Auto-loading based on tech stack, not manual inclusion.
- **Custom overrides built-in** - Team standards take precedence.

### Implementation

- **Single install script** - No npm/pip install required, just curl and run.
- **ShellCheck compliant** - All scripts pass linting.
- **Interactive by default** - Users choose what to install.
