# Auto-Loading Skills

Coding standards that load automatically based on your tech stack.

## How It Works

1. Your project CLAUDE.md declares a tech stack:
   ```markdown
   ## Tech Stack

   - Python, FastAPI
   ```

2. Claude matches this to available skills:
   ```
   Tech Stack: Python, FastAPI
   Skill: standards-python (applies_to: [python, fastapi, django])
   → Match! Loading Python standards.
   ```

3. Standards are applied when writing code.

## Available Skills

| Skill | Loads for |
|-------|-----------|
| `standards-python` | python, fastapi, django, flask, pytest |
| `standards-typescript` | typescript, react, nextjs, vue, angular |
| `standards-javascript` | javascript, nodejs, express, npm |
| `standards-shell` | bash, sh, shell, zsh, shellcheck |

## Task-Based Loading

Even if not in your Tech Stack, skills load when needed:

```
Project Tech Stack: Python

User: Write me a deployment script
Claude: [Loads standards-shell for this .sh file]
```

## Skill Structure

Skills live in `~/.claude/skills/`:

```
~/.claude/skills/
├── standards-python/
│   └── SKILL.md
├── standards-typescript/
│   └── SKILL.md
└── standards-shell/
    └── SKILL.md
```

Each SKILL.md has frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: standards-python
description: Python coding standards
type: context
applies_to: [python, fastapi, django, flask, pytest]
---

# Python Coding Standards

## Naming Conventions
...
```

## Custom Skills Override

Your custom skills in `~/.claude/custom/skills/` override built-in ones:

```
Built-in: ~/.claude/skills/standards-python/
Custom:   ~/.claude/custom/skills/standards-python/

→ Custom wins
```

This lets teams enforce their own standards.
