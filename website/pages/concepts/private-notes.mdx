# Private Notes

Session notes, research, and personal TODOs that stay private and never get committed.

## What Are Private Notes?

Private notes live in `docs/notes/` and are **gitignored by default**. They're for:

- Session logs
- Research results
- Promotion strategies
- Personal TODOs
- Any context that shouldn't be shared

## The `.open` Convention

Use the `.open.md` suffix to mark notes that should be loaded by `/catchup`:

```
docs/notes/
├── session-2026-02-01.open.md   ← /catchup loads this
├── session-2026-01-30.md        ← closed, ignored
└── research-topic.open.md       ← /catchup loads this
```

**Why filename markers?**
- Simple glob pattern: `*.open.md`
- No content parsing needed
- Visible in file listings
- Easy to close: just rename

## Managing Notes

### Create a Note

```bash
# Create an open note (will be loaded by /catchup)
touch docs/notes/my-research.open.md
```

### Close a Note

When done with a note, remove the `.open` suffix:

```bash
mv docs/notes/session-2026-02-01.open.md docs/notes/session-2026-02-01.md
```

Closed notes stay in the folder for reference but won't be loaded.

## How /catchup Uses Notes

1. Globs for `docs/notes/*.open.md`
2. Reads all matching files
3. Summarizes key points
4. Includes context in session start

## Notes vs Records

| Aspect | Private Notes | Records |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| **Visibility** | Private (gitignored) | Public (committed) |
| **Purpose** | Personal context | Team documentation |
| **Lifespan** | Temporary | Permanent |
| **Location** | `docs/notes/` | `docs/records/` |

Use **Notes** for anything you wouldn't want in version control.
Use **Records** for decisions and designs the team should see.

## Setup

The `docs/notes/` directory should be in your `.gitignore`:

```gitignore
# Private notes
docs/notes/
```

This is added automatically by `/init-project`.
