# Context Management

Monitor and manage Claude's context window effectively.

## The Problem

Claude Code has a limited context window. When it fills up:

- **Auto-compact** summarizes and loses details
- **/clear** wipes everything

Both options lose important context.

## The Solution

1. **Monitor** context usage with ccstatusline
2. **Document** before clearing with /wrapup
3. **Resume** after clearing with /catchup

## ccstatusline

[ccstatusline](https://github.com/sirmalloc/ccstatusline) shows context usage in your status bar:

```
Ctx: 45% | Model: opus | Branch: main
```

### Reading the Status

| Level | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 0-50% | Plenty of room | Keep working |
| 50-70% | Getting full | Plan wrap-up point |
| 70-80% | Time to wrap up | Run /wrapup soon |
| 80%+ | Critical | Run /wrapup now |

### Installation

ccstatusline is installed automatically if you select it during setup.

To verify it's working, check your Claude Code settings:
```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "enabled": true,
    "command": ["npx", "-y", "ccstatusline"]
  }
}
```

## Document & Clear Workflow

Instead of auto-compact losing context for you:

```
1. Work until Ctx: ~80%
2. /wrapup → Saves to CLAUDE.md
3. /clear → Fresh context
4. /catchup → Resume with full memory
```

## What Gets Preserved

| Item | Where | Survives /clear? |
|------|-------|------------------|
| Project status | CLAUDE.md | Yes |
| Decisions | Records | Yes |
| Small choices | Recent Decisions | Yes |
| Chat discussion | Context | No |

The point: **External files are your memory**, not the context window.

## Disable Auto-Compact

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout type="warning">
Auto-compact must be disabled for this workflow to work.
</Callout>

See [Disable Auto-Compact](/getting-started/disable-autocompact) for instructions.
