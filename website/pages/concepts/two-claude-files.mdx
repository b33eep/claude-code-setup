# Two CLAUDE.md Files

The core concept of Claude Code Setup: two Markdown files that serve as persistent memory.

## Overview

| File | Location | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Global** | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Your workflow, conventions, preferences |
| **Project** | `your-project/CLAUDE.md` | Current status, tasks, next steps |

Both files load automatically when you start Claude Code.

## Global CLAUDE.md

Located at `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, this file contains:

- **Workflow instructions** - How to use /catchup, /wrapup, etc.
- **Conventions** - Commit message format, code style preferences
- **Skill loading rules** - When to load which coding standards
- **User Instructions** - Your personal customizations (preserved during updates)

This file applies to **all projects**.

## Project CLAUDE.md

Located in your project root, this file contains:

- **Project overview** - Name, description, tech stack
- **Current Status** - Active tasks with status and notes
- **Records table** - Links to design decisions
- **Recent Decisions** - Small decisions that survive /clear
- **Development commands** - Project-specific commands

This file is **project-specific**.

## How They Work Together

```
~/.claude/CLAUDE.md          your-project/CLAUDE.md
┌─────────────────────┐      ┌─────────────────────┐
│ Workflow rules      │      │ Project: MyApp      │
│ Conventions         │  +   │ Status: Auth done   │
│ Skill loading       │      │ Next: Add logout    │
│ User preferences    │      │ Records: [001, 002] │
└─────────────────────┘      └─────────────────────┘
           │                          │

                      ▼
              Claude knows:
              - HOW to work (global)
              - WHAT to work on (project)
```

## User Instructions Section

The global CLAUDE.md has a special section at the bottom:

```markdown
<!-- USER INSTRUCTIONS START -->
Add your personal preferences here.
This section survives updates.
<!-- USER INSTRUCTIONS END -->
```

Put your customizations here:
- Language preferences
- Personal conventions
- Tool preferences
- Credential locations
