# Records

Design decisions, implementation plans, and feature specs that persist across sessions.

## What Are Records?

Records are Markdown files in `docs/records/` that document:

- Architecture decisions
- Feature specifications
- Design documents
- Implementation plans

They start as planning docs and turn into permanent documentation over time.

## When to Create a Record

| Situation | Record? | Why |
|-----------|---------|-----|
| Feature spanning multiple sessions | Yes | Details don't belong in CLAUDE.md |
| Architecture/design decision | Yes | "Why X instead of Y" for future reference |
| Complex implementation plan | Yes | Steps + acceptance criteria |
| Bug fix | No | Code comment or commit message suffices |
| Small change | No | Commit message suffices |

**Rule of thumb:** If you'd write more than 5 lines in CLAUDE.md → create a Record.

**Tip:** Use [/design](/commands/design) for complex features - it auto-generates Records with Problem, Options, Solution, and User Stories sections.

## Record Format

```
docs/records/
├── 001-authentication-design.md
├── 002-api-refactoring.md
└── 003-caching-strategy.md
```

Each Record follows this structure:

```markdown
# Record 001: Authentication Design

**Status:** Done
**Priority:** High
**Date:** 2026-01-15

## Records vs Recent Decisions

| Layer | Persistence | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Records | Permanent | Architecture decisions, feature specs |
| Recent Decisions | Temporary (max 20) | "pip --user for yt-dlp" |
| Chat | Lost after /clear | Discussion context |

**Recent Decisions** are for small **project-level** choices with a "why" worth remembering, but too small for a full Record. Implementation details of a specific feature belong in the Record, not in Recent Decisions.

## How Records Are Used

1. **During work:** Create Records when making significant decisions
2. **/wrapup:** References active Records in Current Status table
3. **/catchup:** Loads Records referenced in active work
4. **On disk:** `ls docs/records/` lists all Records — no separate table needed
