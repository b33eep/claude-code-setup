# Session Workflow

A practical guide to working with Claude Code Setup. Sessions typically last 30-90 minutes before context fills up.

## The Session Cycle

```
┌─────────────────┐
│   /catchup      │  ← Start every session here
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│     Work        │  ← Implement, decide, document
│  (30-90 min)    │
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│   /wrapup       │  ← When Ctx hits ~80%
│   /clear        │
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         └──────────→ Next session
```

## Start: /catchup

Every session begins the same way:

```
/catchup
```

Claude loads:
- Recent Git changes
- Your project's CLAUDE.md status
- Relevant Records for in-progress work
- Coding standards for your tech stack

**Output example:**
```
Project: my-api
Tech Stack: Python, FastAPI

Recent changes (last 3 commits):
- Added user authentication
- Fixed rate limiting bug

Records loaded:
- Record 012: Auth design (in progress)

Next step: Implement password reset
```

## Work: The Session

### Pick a Task

Look at what `/catchup` suggested, or check the Current Status table in CLAUDE.md.

### Implement

Work normally. Coding standards are already loaded.

### Track Decisions

**Significant decisions** → Create a Record:
```
Create a Record for why we chose JWT over sessions
```

**Small decisions** → Add to Recent Decisions:
```
Add to Recent Decisions: Using bcrypt with cost=12 for password hashing
```

### Add Tasks That Come Up

```
/todo Add rate limiting to auth endpoints
```

### Watch Context

Your status line shows usage:
```
Ctx: 45% | Model: opus | Branch: main
```

| Level | Action |
|-------|--------|
| 0-60% | Keep working |
| 60-80% | Plan your stopping point |
| 80%+ | Run /wrapup now |

## End: /wrapup + /clear

When context approaches 80%:

```
/wrapup
```

Claude:
- Updates CLAUDE.md with current status
- Creates/syncs any new Records
- Commits changes

Then:

```
/clear
```

Your next session starts fresh with `/catchup`.

## Multiple Sessions Per Day

It's normal to have 2-5 sessions per day on an active project:

| Session | Focus | Duration |
|---------|-------|----------|
| 1 | Fix auth bug | 45 min |
| 2 | Add password reset | 60 min |
| 3 | Code review feedback | 30 min |
| 4 | Write tests | 50 min |

Each session follows the same cycle: `/catchup` → work → `/wrapup` → `/clear`

## Quick Session (Under 30 min)

For small tasks, you might not need the full cycle:

```
/catchup
Fix the typo in the header
Done - no /wrapup needed for trivial changes
/clear
```

Use `/wrapup` when:
- You made significant progress
- You created or updated Records
- The next session needs context

## Tips

- **Start with /catchup** - Even if you just cleared 5 minutes ago
- **Don't wait for 100%** - Context quality degrades before hitting the limit
- **Add decisions immediately** - Not at /wrapup time
- **Short sessions are fine** - Better to clear often than lose context
- **Records are cheap** - Create them liberally
