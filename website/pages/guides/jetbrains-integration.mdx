# JetBrains Integration

Connect Claude Code to your JetBrains IDE for debugging, code navigation, and more.

Two MCP servers are available for JetBrains IDEs. They complement each other and can run side by side.

## Debugger MCP Server (Plugin)

Gives Claude full control over the IDE's debugger — set breakpoints, step through code, inspect variables, evaluate expressions.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Plugin | [Debugger MCP Server](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/29233-debugger-mcp-server) |
| Source | [GitHub](https://github.com/hechtcarmel/jetbrains-debugger-mcp-plugin) |
| Transport | SSE |
| Requires | JetBrains IDE 2025.1+, JVM 21+ |

### What It Does

- **Breakpoints** — Line breakpoints, conditional breakpoints, and tracepoints
- **Execution control** — Step over, step into, step out, resume, pause, run to line
- **Variable inspection** — View and modify variables during debugging
- **Expression evaluation** — Run arbitrary expressions in the current debug context
- **Stack & threads** — Inspect call stacks and navigate thread states
- **Session management** — Start/stop debug sessions, get comprehensive status

### Setup

1. In your JetBrains IDE: **Settings → Plugins → Marketplace** → search "Debugger MCP Server" → Install → Restart IDE
2. Open the **"Debugger MCP Server" tool window** (bottom panel)
3. Click **"Install on Coding Agents"** → select Claude Code

The plugin configures `~/.claude.json` automatically with the correct port.

### Manual Configuration

If you prefer manual setup:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport sse jetbrains-debugger http://127.0.0.1:<PORT>/debugger-mcp/sse
```

Find your port in the plugin's tool window (it shows `Server started at http://127.0.0.1:<PORT>/debugger-mcp/sse`).

### Usage

Start a debug session in your IDE, then ask Claude:

```
"Set a conditional breakpoint at MyService.java:42 where userId == null"
"Step through the calculatePremium method and show me the variables"
"What's the current call stack?"
"Evaluate this.getConfig().isEnabled() in the current context"
```

### Supported IDEs

IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, WebStorm, GoLand, PhpStorm, RubyMine, CLion, Rider, Android Studio (Community & Professional editions).

## Built-in MCP Server (JetBrains 2025.2+)

Since version 2025.2, all JetBrains IDEs include a **built-in MCP server** for IDE features like project navigation, inspections, search, and refactoring.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Source | Built into all JetBrains IDEs |
| Docs | [JetBrains Documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/mcp-server.html) |
| Requires | JetBrains IDE 2025.2+ |

### Setup

1. In your IDE: **Settings → Tools → MCP Server → Enable MCP Server**
2. In the **Clients Auto-Configuration** section, click **Auto-Configure** for Claude Code

The IDE writes the config to `~/.claude.json` directly. No manual configuration needed.

### What It Does

- Project navigation and file search
- Code inspections and error analysis
- Symbol lookup and documentation
- Run configurations and terminal commands

## Using Both Together

The two servers complement each other:

| Capability | Debugger MCP | Built-in MCP |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Breakpoints & stepping | Yes | No |
| Variable inspection | Yes | No |
| Expression evaluation | Yes | No |
| Project navigation | No | Yes |
| Code inspections | No | Yes |
| Run configurations | No | Yes |

Both can be active simultaneously — they use separate endpoints and don't conflict.

## Notes

- Both MCP servers only work when the IDE is open
- Each IDE instance uses its own port — check the plugin's tool window or IDE settings for the correct URL
- Claude will report connection errors if the IDE is closed or the plugin is not installed
