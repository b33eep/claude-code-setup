# Creating Skills

Build your own custom skills for Claude Code Setup.

## Skill Types

| Type | How it loads | Example |
|------|--------------|---------|
| **Context** | Auto-loads based on tech stack | Coding standards |
| **Command** | User invokes with /skill-name | Presentation creator |

## Using /skill-creator

The easiest way to create a skill:

```
/skill-creator
```

Claude will ask:
1. What type of skill?
2. What should it do?
3. What tech stacks should trigger it?

## Manual Creation

### Directory Structure

```
~/.claude/custom/skills/
└── my-skill/
    └── SKILL.md
```

### SKILL.md Format

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: What this skill does
type: context
applies_to: [python, fastapi]
file_extensions: [".py"]
---

# Skill Content

Instructions and standards here...
```

## Context Skill Example

```markdown
---
name: api-standards
description: REST API design standards
type: context
applies_to: [python, typescript, nodejs, fastapi, express]
file_extensions: [".py", ".ts"]
---

# API Design Standards

## Endpoints

- Use nouns, not verbs: `/users` not `/getUsers`
- Use plural nouns: `/users` not `/user`
- Nest resources: `/users/{id}/orders`

## HTTP Methods

| Method | Purpose | Response |
|--------|---------|----------|
| GET | Read | 200 + data |
| POST | Create | 201 + created resource |
| PUT | Replace | 200 + updated resource |
| PATCH | Update | 200 + updated resource |
| DELETE | Delete | 204 no content |

## Error Responses

\`\`\`json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Human readable message",
    "details": [...]
  }
}
\`\`\`
```

## Command Skill Example

```markdown
---
name: create-api-spec
description: Create OpenAPI specification
type: command
---

# Create API Spec

When invoked, create an OpenAPI 3.0 specification:

1. Analyze existing routes in the codebase
2. Generate openapi.yaml with:
   - Info section with project details
   - All endpoints with parameters
   - Request/response schemas
   - Error responses
3. Save to docs/openapi.yaml
```

## Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Skill identifier (kebab-case) |
| `description` | Yes | What the skill does (single-line) |
| `type` | Yes | `context` or `command` |
| `applies_to` | Context only | Tech stack triggers |
| `file_extensions` | Context only | File extensions for task-based loading (e.g., `[".py"]`) |

## Optional Files

Beyond `SKILL.md`, skills can include additional files:

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md              # Required — skill definition
├── deps.json             # System dependencies to install
├── assets/               # Templates, reusable content
├── references/           # Reference docs Claude can read
└── test-project/         # Example project for testing
```

### deps.json

Declares system dependencies that the installer handles per platform:

```json
{
  "dependencies": [
    {
      "name": "yt-dlp",
      "install": {
        "macos": "brew install yt-dlp",
        "debian": "apt-get install -y yt-dlp",
        "arch": "pacman -S --noconfirm yt-dlp"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### references/

Markdown files that Claude reads alongside the SKILL.md. Useful for code review checklists, pattern libraries, or API references that would make the main SKILL.md too long.

### assets/

Reusable content like templates. For example, `create-slidev-presentation` includes slide layout templates here.

### test-project/

A working example project. `standards-gradle` includes a full Gradle project that demonstrates the conventions from the skill.

## Overriding Built-in Skills

Put your skill in `~/.claude/custom/skills/` with the same name:

```
Built-in: ~/.claude/skills/standards-python/
Custom:   ~/.claude/custom/skills/standards-python/

→ Custom wins
```
