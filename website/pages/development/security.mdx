# Security

Security model and vulnerability reporting for Claude Code Setup.

## Trust Model

Claude Code Setup modifies files in `~/.claude/` and `~/.claude.json`. Understanding the trust model:

### What We Install

| Component | Source | Trust Level |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| CLAUDE.md templates | This repo | Reviewed |
| Commands | This repo | Reviewed |
| Skills | This repo | Reviewed |
| MCP servers | npm packages | Third-party |
| Custom modules | User-provided Git | User responsibility |

### User Responsibility

- **Custom modules**: You're responsible for reviewing custom module repositories before using `/add-custom`
- **API keys**: Store in environment variables or `.env` files, never in CLAUDE.md
- **MCP servers**: npm packages are third-party; review before enabling

## Best Practices

### API Keys

Never put secrets in CLAUDE.md:

```markdown
<!-- BAD - Don't do this -->
API_KEY=sk-secret-123

<!-- GOOD - Reference location -->
API keys are in ~/.config/secrets/.env
```

### Custom Modules

Before installing custom modules:

1. Review the repository
2. Check the SKILL.md and MCP configs
3. Verify the source is trusted

### File Permissions

The installer creates files with default permissions. For sensitive configs:

```bash
chmod 600 ~/.claude.json  # Restrict MCP config with API keys
```

## Vulnerability Reporting

Found a security issue?

1. **Do not** open a public issue
2. Use [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/b33eep/claude-code-setup/security/advisories/new)
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact

We'll respond within 48 hours.

## Security Updates

Security fixes are released as soon as possible:

1. Patch is developed and tested
2. Released with `fix(security):` commit
3. Users update via `/claude-code-setup`

Check the [Changelog](/changelog) for security updates.
