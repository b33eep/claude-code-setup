## What It Does

Guides you through creating a custom skill:

1. **Choose skill type**
   - Context skill (auto-loads based on tech stack)
   - Command skill (invoked manually)

2. **Define metadata**
   - Name (kebab-case)
   - Description
   - For context: `applies_to` tech stacks

3. **Write content**
   - Standards, guidelines, or instructions
   - Examples and code snippets

4. **Save skill**
   - Creates `~/.claude/custom/skills/your-skill/SKILL.md`

## Example Session

```
You: /skill-creator

Claude: What type of skill do you want to create?
        1) Context skill - Auto-loads based on tech stack
        2) Command skill - Invoked with /skill-name

You: 1

Claude: What's the skill name? (kebab-case, e.g., api-standards)

You: api-standards

Claude: What tech stacks should trigger this skill?
        (comma-separated, e.g., python, typescript, nodejs)

You: python, typescript, fastapi, express

Claude: Describe what standards this skill should enforce:

You: REST API design standards for our team...

Claude: Created ~/.claude/custom/skills/api-standards/SKILL.md
```

## Output Location

Skills are saved to:

```
~/.claude/custom/skills/
└── your-skill/
    └── SKILL.md
```

## Skill Format

The wizard generates:

```markdown
---
name: your-skill
description: Your description
type: context
applies_to: [python, typescript]
file_extensions: [".py", ".ts"]
---

# Your Skill Title

Content you provided...
```

## Tips

- Include examples in your standards - Claude follows concrete examples better than abstract rules
- One topic per skill, don't mix concerns
- Test with a matching project to see if the standards actually load
