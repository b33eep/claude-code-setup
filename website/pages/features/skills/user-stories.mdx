## Usage

The skill loads automatically during `/design` Step 4 (User Stories) if installed. You can also ask Claude to apply it when writing stories outside of `/design`.

## What It Covers

- **User Story Template** — As a / I want / So that
- **Story Types** — Feature, Improvement, Bug Fix, Enabler
- **Persona Reference** — End User, Admin, Power User, New User
- **INVEST Criteria** — Validate every story (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable)
- **Acceptance Criteria** — Given-When-Then patterns with checklist (happy path, validation, error handling, performance, accessibility)
- **Story Splitting** — Techniques for breaking down large stories
- **Antipatterns** — Common mistakes in stories and acceptance criteria

## What It Does NOT Cover

Sprint planning, velocity tracking, and epic breakdown are out of scope. This skill focuses on individual story quality only.

## Example

When running `/design`, Step 4 produces stories like:

```
### Story 1: Export campaign reports
**As a** marketing manager,
**I want** to export campaign reports to PDF,
**So that** I can share results with stakeholders who don't have system access.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given the user is on the reports page,
  When they click "Export PDF",
  Then a PDF download starts within 2 seconds.
- Given the report contains charts,
  When exported to PDF,
  Then all charts render correctly in the document.
- Given the export fails due to a server error,
  When the user clicks "Export PDF",
  Then a user-friendly error message is displayed.

**INVEST:** Independent (no dependencies), Valuable (clear benefit),
Small (single feature), Testable (3 concrete AC).
```
