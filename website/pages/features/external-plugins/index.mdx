# External Plugins

Install official Claude Code plugins via the installer.

## How It Works

External plugins are installed using the official `claude plugin` CLI. The installer:

1. Registers the plugin marketplace (if needed)
2. Installs the plugin via `claude plugin install`
3. Enables the plugin automatically

This is different from [Skills](/features/skills) (which are copied to `~/.claude/skills/`). External plugins are managed by Claude Code itself.

## Available Plugins

### Document Creation

- [document-skills](/features/external-plugins/document-skills) - Excel, Word, PowerPoint, PDF

### Code Quality

- [code-review-ai](/features/external-plugins/code-review-ai) - Architectural review (recommended)

## Installation

External plugins are offered during installation:

```bash
./install.sh        # Fresh install
./install.sh --add  # Add to existing installation
```

You'll see a selection like:

```
External Plugins (via Claude CLI):

    ○ document-skills - Excel, Word, PowerPoint, PDF creation/editing
  ❯ ◉ code-review-ai - AI-powered architectural review (recommended)

  ↑↓ navigate  ⎵ toggle  ⏎ confirm
```

## Manual Installation

You can also install plugins directly via Claude Code:

```bash
# Add marketplace (once)
claude plugin marketplace add anthropics/skills

# Install plugin
claude plugin install document-skills@anthropic-agent-skills

# List installed plugins
claude plugin list
```

## Adding Custom Plugins

Create `~/.claude/custom/external-plugins.json`:

```json
{
  "marketplaces": {
    "my-company": {
      "repo": "mycompany/claude-plugins",
      "description": "Internal company plugins"
    }
  },
  "plugins": [
    {
      "id": "company-standards",
      "marketplace": "my-company",
      "description": "Company coding standards"
    }
  ]
}
```

These will appear in the installer alongside the default plugins.

## Requirements

- Claude Code CLI must be installed and available
- Network access during installation (plugins are downloaded)
- If CLI is not available, external plugins are skipped silently
