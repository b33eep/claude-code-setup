# comprehensive-review

AI-powered code review with architecture, quality, and security agents.

## Overview

| Field | Value |

| Marketplace | claude-code-workflows |
| Source | [wshobson/agents](https://github.com/wshobson/agents) |
| License | MIT |
| Default | Pre-selected (recommended) |

## Why Recommended?

This plugin integrates with our [development workflow](/concepts/workflow). The [`/do-review`](/commands/do-review) command uses its agents for multi-perspective code review.

```
1. SPECIFY
         │
         ▼
2. IMPLEMENT
         │
         ▼
3. CODE REVIEW  ◄──── comprehensive-review
   - Run /do-review
   - Incorporate feedback
```

## Agents

The plugin provides 3 specialized review agents:

| Agent | Focus | Used by |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `architect-review` | Architecture, design patterns, SOLID, scalability | `/do-review` (always), `/design --review` |
| `code-reviewer` | Code quality, maintainability, error handling, best practices | `/do-review` (always) |
| `security-auditor` | OWASP, vulnerabilities, auth, injection, secrets | `/do-review --security` or `--full` |

Agents run **in parallel** for fast reviews.

## Installation

### Via Installer

```bash
./install.sh        # Fresh install
./install.sh --add  # Add to existing
```

comprehensive-review is pre-selected by default.

### Manual

```bash
# Add marketplace
claude plugin marketplace add wshobson/agents

# Install plugin
claude plugin install comprehensive-review@claude-code-workflows
```

## Usage

### Via /do-review (recommended)

The [`/do-review`](/commands/do-review) command is the primary way to trigger this plugin:

```
/do-review                    # 2 agents: architect-review + code-reviewer
/do-review --security         # 3 agents: + security-auditor
/do-review --full             # 3 agents (alias for --security)
/do-review --branch           # Review branch vs main
/do-review --branch --full    # Full review before PR
```

It automatically gathers the diff, loads coding standards, and spawns agents in parallel.

### Via /design --review

The [`/design --review`](/commands/design) command uses `architect-review` for design feedback.

### Direct Request

```
"Review this PR for architectural issues"
"Analyze the security of this module"
"Check this code for best practices"
```

### Via Task Tool

The plugin provides subagents that can be spawned via the Task tool:

```
subagent_type: "comprehensive-review:architect-review"
subagent_type: "comprehensive-review:code-reviewer"
subagent_type: "comprehensive-review:security-auditor"
```

## Review Output

Each agent provides focused feedback:

- **architect-review** — Design concerns, dependency issues, pattern violations
- **code-reviewer** — Quality improvements, maintainability, error handling gaps
- **security-auditor** — Vulnerabilities, OWASP findings, auth/validation issues

Results are grouped by perspective for easy reading.

## Integration with Workflow

After implementing a feature:

1. Run `/do-review` (or `/do-review --full` for sensitive changes)
2. Agents review the changes in parallel
3. Feedback is incorporated
4. Code is committed

This catches issues before they get committed.

See [`/do-review`](/commands/do-review) for details.
