# Catchup: Understand Changed Files

After `/clear` or new chat, understand recent changes.

## Tasks

1. **Read changed files**
   - If Git: `git diff --name-only HEAD~10` (last 10 commits)
   - Or: `git status` for uncommitted changes
   - Read relevant changed files

2. **Summary**
   - What was recently changed?
   - What's the next step according to CLAUDE.md?
